## Criterion A: Planning

### Problem definition
“The Good Old Times” (in this document referred to as TGOT) is a new business that lets an international boarding school’s students buy international and traditional food from all over the world, with the mission to tackle students’ homesickness and make them feel more comfortable on campus. However, the founder has expressed difficulties accessing these foods because the school is located in a relatively remote area. As a result, she wishes to implement some sort of online platform that showcases all the products and allows students to order them by selecting them to solve this problem. 

There are also other issues stemming from the main problem. As of current, students in this school often mistaken other students’ packages as theirs, and some even take others’ deliveries on purpose. Hence, the founder of TGOT wishes for a way to identify these students when they are paying on delivery when the packages arrive. The information students are willing to share are their emails and names (both first and last name), but it would be better if the identification process is more simple and secure instead of entering phone numbers every time. Moreover, the students would need to be notified when packages are delivered because food has a short expiry date. 

Another problem is that some students have dietary restrictions such as halal or vegetarian, therefore the founder would like students to have access to the detailed information on each product. And due to students’ limited budgets, they should be able to double check their total spending before they confirm the order.

### Proposed Solution


### Success Criteria (Be more specific than this, more specific = better)
1. The application includes a log-in/registration system to identify students. 
    - [Issue tackled: “students in this school often mistaken other students’ packages as theirs, and some even take others’ deliveries on purpose”, “but it would be better if the identification process is more secure”]

2. The application showcases all the products prepopulated in the main page clearly with an option for the items to be selected by clicking on the image
    - [Issue tackled: “she wishes to implement some sort of online platform that showcases all the products and allows students to order them by selecting them”]

3. Once a product is selected, a new window opens with a detailed description (allergens, ingredients) and picture of the product, with the option to add it to their cart. 
    - [Issue tackled: “Another problem is that some students have dietary restrictions such as halal or vegetarian, therefore the founder would like students to have access to the detailed information on each product”]

4. The application allows users to save the product to cart to confirm order for later, and upon clicking the cart icon, a page would showcase the total cost of the order with a confirm button that confirms the order.
    - [Issue tackled: “And due to students’ limited budgets, they should be able to double check their total spending before they confirm the order.”]

5. When the package is ordered, a pop up notification would appear on the screen of the user to inform them of the estimated arrival time.  
    - [Issue tackled: “Moreover, the students would need to be notified when packages are delivered because food has a short expiry date.”]
