# Reflection for Unit 3
## Q1. What was the most proud moment for you during this project?
I felt the proudest during this project when I finished all the code for the application, tested it out with the test table's instructions, and everything worked. I also felt really proud when, after I submitted, I scrolled through the repository and see that it looks quite professional, especially the diagrams. 


## Q2. What worked well this time?
My time management improved significantly. Though I did most of the application code in two days (14 hours) in the library and pulled an all-nighter before submission, I finished criteria B really early on and constantly reviewed them to improve them. This allowed a lot of time for me to check my work, resulting in only minor mistakes in Criteria B, where I lost half the marks last time due to mistakes in diagrams that I could have prevented if I had more time to double check, as I mentioned in my reflection last time. 


## Q3. What will you do differently for Unit 4/IA?
I will try to manage my time for criteria C better, as I left my self one night (5 hours) to finish criteria C and D, and I was half awake while doing it, I didn't really do well on it. Moreover, I did not take notes from last time's feedback, which I did this time, to avoid future mistakes like forgetting what proposed solution should include and not putting success criteria next to my application in criteria D. 


## Q4. What do you need help with?
I don't think I need help with much as most of my mistakes could fully be prevented if I took more notice and prepared better. However, I feel like I need help with diagrams, as we didn't go through it in details in class (formatting, symbols) so I had to look for online resources and seek help from seniors. But the online resources aren't consistent and seniors also said they don't know. This made me take a long time on diagrams (around 2 hours per diagram) as opposed to what I planned (45 minutes on one diagram + double checking).
